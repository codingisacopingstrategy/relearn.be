unless noted otherwise.

As the copyright holders, we open up these materials for your to use if you 
want to.

Different types of materials have different licenses. This is to be 
accomodating to different use cases and cultures that have arisen around 
different digital formats.

The licenses we use are copyleft. That means that you are free to reuse, 
modify and redistribute our materials, and that you are also allowed to make 
money doing so. You have to, however, redistribute your own variants under 
the same license. This means that the ecology of sharing is stimulated.

All code written in programming languages is licensed under the Affero GPL 
v3. This is a variant of the GPLv3 copyleft license, that makes sure that 
deploying your code online also counts as distribution, and thus, as an 
incentive to re-share your modified code.

All texts written in natural languages, and all drawings and visual designs, 
are dual licensed under the Free Art License 1.3 and Creative Commons 
Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported.

- The Free Art License, because we feel that the spirit of it is beautiful 
and simple seems the closest to the way we think creation can be shared. 

- Creative Commons, because a lot of people take part in this ecosystem. 
If you modify our work, you are free to license your version under either of 
them (or both).

All original typefaces are licensed under the SIL Open Font License. This 
copyleft license is the first license written specifically for fonts. If we 
base our font on an existing font, we reutilise the original license. The 
metadata of the font is conclusive in this case.

Not all files in the repository might be copyrighted by us. For example, 
posters often include logos from supporting institutions. Folders with 
documentation might include images made by others. In these cases, a separate 
README.txt in the folder will inform you of the rights situation.

Also note that while we are the owners of the copyright of all the original 
works contained in the repository, there are other rights that we can’t 
necessarily control. For instance, a copyleft photograph can still be subject 
to the personality rights of the persons depicted. In certain jurisdictions, 
original work might still be subject to trademark laws (as our friends Lafkon 
state).

If  you are not certain of the license of a file that you want to re-use,  
please feel free to ask us directly by email: mail@osp.constantvzw.org.
